Title: In the Meantime...Devlog Week 7
---

Since my group will reconvene once all of our photos are inputted into Tropy, in the meantime, I decided to try customizing my website a little bit. I changed the menu bar from “Posts” to “Devlogs”. Although when I click on Devlogs now at the top of my website, it doesn’t take me to it so there is a problem with the URL. I changed it back to Posts as an experiment and that worked again. I’m not sure what the problem is but I decided to keep it as Devlogs for now. I also removed the “Publications” section on my website because it isn’t in use right now. I can add it again later when there are publications to put in. 

In class, Professor Graham showed me how to fix the url problem with “devlogs” that I was having earlier in the week. He told me to not change the name of the url from “posts” to “devlogs” because that information is hidden on my site. That fixed the problem. I also changed the title from Recent Posts to Recent Devlogs on the left side of the screen. 

I also tried to download Transkribus and test it out but my computer didn’t allow it to open. I received this message: Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac App Store and identified developers. I don't know if we will need this software for our project but I am really curious to try it out. Professor Graham says he will send me instructions so I will try again later.

I also want to upload a photo of the catalogue cards that we have been dealing with to show what they look like. I tried looking for instructions on the course website on how to upload a photo but I couldn't find it. I noticed that my classmate Chloe included a photo in one of her devlogs so I emailed her and she graciously helped me out by showing me that I need to upload the photo into the static folder first and then write in the code. I did so successfully!
