Unfortunately I was sick in Week 3 and was unable to attend the visit to the Museum of History. As a result, however, I visited Professor Graham’s office hours to discuss what I missed and received a great crash course in what exactly we are setting out to do in this course and how these different online tools will help us achieve these goals.

Before visiting his office hours, I had created accounts for Github and Netlify and created a domain for my website. Good start. But when I started trying to change my avatar and update the info on my site, I couldn’t figure out what to do next. I felt like I was going in circles, switching back and forth between Github and Netlify searching for answers. My initial frustrations trying to operate these tools exacerbated some of the hesitations I had about taking this course. I have never been “techy.” But I reminded myself why I chose to be here—I wanted to challenge myself to learn new skills in the world of digital humanities, a field that is growing fast. 

I felt a whole lot better after meeting with Professor Graham who made me realize that trying to figure this all out is like learning a new language. EOF=end of file, MD=mark down, using quotes and colons in ways that don’t make sense in proper sentences. All of this is foreign to me but just like any language, practicing to speak and write, and most importantly making mistakes is all part of the journey. Reading Matthew Lincoln’s “Some problems with GLAM data on Github” really felt like reading in a different language. For example he writes, “Do you have a nightly cron job set up to push out internal CMS updates to your repo?” I could have read this sentence fifty times a month ago and have no idea what he is saying! But just like any language, you need to learn the vocabulary to understand the message. I am improving my vocabulary and my ability to “speak” this new language each week.
