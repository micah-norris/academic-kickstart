+ I visited the Museum of Nature for the first time last weekend with a friend visiting from Toronto so I was excited to get a behind-the-scenes look at how the museum manages their collection. After splitting with the Museum of History in the 1960s some items remained at the Museum of History even though their calling cards relocated to the Museum of Nature and the same problem happened with their photo collection. 50 years later and they are still working to “reassemble the jigsaw”, as Professor Graham put it, and decide which museum these items best fit in. The museum staff made a comment that they are behind in digitization which is why they never got rid of original papers, which I think is actually a good thing. I am a strong believer that even after digitizing, the physical record should still be kept because it remains the only original version. Technology has progressed so significantly that accessing outdated forms of digital copies can be a struggle, and even its own type of archive, which is the case at the Nature Museum who said that lots of their information is currently on floppy discs where they are no use to anyone. Data is only useful if people can access it. So while digitizing is a great tool for creating better access to the public, it should not be relied on as the preferred method for record keeping. 

+ From its earliest days, museums have been assigned two roles: to educate the general public and to be a storehouse of unique and authentic objects for the study of trained professionals.  I have only ever experienced the first role of museums so getting a tour of the Nature Museum’s storage facility was a real treat. We ventured behind multiple doors and in to a separate building with its own plumbing and fire safety procedures. This tour really showed me how much of the museum’s collection is not on display to the public at one time. One thing I was definitely not ready for was the smell. I have this notion that museum spaces are perfectly regulated and controlled, from their preservation techniques to the room temperature, but after smelling the whalebones I learned that some things are outside of anyone’s control. 

+ A large part of their collection, especially in the large mammal section, came from individual donations by people who most likely inherited these items from a family member and didn’t know what to do with them, so donated to a museum. The museum has more items than they know what to do with (how many buffalo skulls does one museum need?) but I think it is better to be kept in a museum than in an individual’s care where they could be improperly cared for or be at greater risk of ending up on the black market. All in all, I had a great time at the museum and am looking forward to a different kind of museum experience at the Science and Tech Museum.
